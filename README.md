# Codeforces problemsets

This repo holds all my solutions for non-competition problemsets on Codeforces.

I initially didn't plan to store these on GitHub, but I thought it might be benefitial when I was about to refactor a prior solution and thought that I might want to store the history of the old solution.

nb. I'm not releasing any previously inaccessible code, all Codeforces submissions are generally available (outside of live contents).
